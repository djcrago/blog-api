The main focus of this project was to create a backend api that would service multiple front-end web apps.

The service provided is a blog api, where published posts, drafts, post comments, and users are stored on a database, accessed by the backend API, and sent as JSON responses to the fetch requests made by two front-end apps.

The two front-end apps include:

- An app for people that want to read and comment of the posts
- An app for the author of the posts to write, edit, and delete posts and delete comments.
