# Blog Api

This repository houses three connected projects that make up an example blog website. A backend API (the "backend" directory), a website where visitors can read and comment on blog posts (the "frontend-user" directory), and a website for the blog author to create, edit, and delete blog posts (the "frontend-owner" directory).

Live websites can be found here:

- For visitors: https://djcrago.github.io/blog-api-user/
- For the author: https://djcrago.github.io/blog-api-owner/
