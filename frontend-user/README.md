# Blog Api - User

This repository houses an example blog website where visitors can read and comment on blog posts.
The live website can be found here: https://djcrago.github.io/blog-api-user/

This website accesses a "public" API endpoint which only provides posts the author has published (not the drafts they haven't yet).
